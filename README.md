### Previous Releases

* All historical releases [are available here](https://github.com/encryptic-team/encryptic/releases).

## Developer Install & Documentation

Setting up the Encryptic development environment only takes a few minutes. To run locally, you need to have the following installed:
* [Node.js version 8.11.4 or 10.9.0](https://nodejs.org/). Encryptic works with other previous Node versions, but requires changes to `package.json` and is not recommended.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) (note: Windows users need to set the PATH variable for git after installation).
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) You can use npm but it's not recommended due to inconsistencies observed in the modules installed.
